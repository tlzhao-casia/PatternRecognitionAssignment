# Parametric & Non-Parametric Classification

### Dependency

* pytorch
* numpy

### Description

This is the first assignment of my class: Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning. 
I implement five classifiers (QDF, LDF, MQDF, RDA and Parzen window), and evaluate 
these five classifiers on 3 datasets (iris, wine and wdbc). Considering that for 
wine and wdbc, the dimension of features is high, while data samples are limited, 
so for these 2 datasets, I first normalize the data with their means and variances,
and then compress the data to 4 dimensions with PCA.
